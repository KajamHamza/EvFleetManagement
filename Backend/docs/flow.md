# Vehicle Information Flow

## Vehicle Registration and Validation Flow

1. **Vehicle Registration**
   - Driver registers through `/api/auth/register/driver`
   - System validates username, email, and password
   - Driver account is created with `DRIVER` role

2. **Vehicle VIN Validation**
   - Driver provides VIN during vehicle registration
   - System validates VIN through `/api/simulation/vehicles/validate-vin/{vin}`
   - VIN validation checks:
     - Length (17 characters)
     - Valid characters (A-H, J-N, P, R-Z, 0-9)
     - Uniqueness (not already registered)

3. **Vehicle State Management**
   - Vehicle states are tracked in the `vehicle_states` table
   - States include: AVAILABLE, IN_USE, CHARGING, MAINTENANCE
   - State changes are logged with timestamps

4. **Vehicle Data Flow**
   - Vehicle information is stored in the `vehicles` table
   - Real-time data (battery level, location, speed) is updated through simulation
   - Historical data is maintained in the `vehicle_states` table

## Data Integration Points

1. **Simulation Integration**
   - Simulation vehicles can be loaded from JSON files
   - Data includes: VIN, make, model, year, battery info, location
   - Simulation updates vehicle states in real-time

2. **Driver-Vehicle Association**
   - Drivers are associated with vehicles through the `vehicles` table
   - One driver can be associated with multiple vehicles
   - Vehicle ownership can be transferred between drivers

3. **Charging Integration**
   - Vehicles can be connected to charging stations
   - Charging sessions are tracked in the `charging_sessions` table
   - Battery levels are updated during charging

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**
   - All endpoints require JWT authentication
   - Role-based access control for different user types
   - Secure password storage with BCrypt

2. **Data Validation**
   - Input validation for all API endpoints
   - VIN validation before vehicle registration
   - State transition validation

## Current Gaps and Improvements Needed

1. **Vehicle Connection Validation**
   - Need to implement vehicle connection status check
   - Add endpoint to verify vehicle-driver association
   - Implement real-time vehicle status updates

2. **Data Synchronization**
   - Need to implement real-time data sync between simulation and database
   - Add WebSocket support for live updates
   - Implement data consistency checks

3. **Error Handling**
   - Add comprehensive error handling for vehicle operations
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed operations
   - Add logging for debugging and monitoring
