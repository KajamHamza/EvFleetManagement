# EV Fleet Management Backend Development Process

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step process for building the EV Fleet Management backend. We'll follow an incremental approach, building and testing each functionality before moving to the next.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Infrastructure
1. **Project Initialization**
   - Set up Spring Boot project with required dependencies
   - Configure PostgreSQL (Neon) connection
   - Set up basic project structure following MVC architecture
   - Create initial README.md with setup instructions

2. **Database Schema Setup**
   - Create database tables based on the schema
   - Implement JPA entities
   - Set up repository interfaces
   - Test database connection

### Phase 2: Authentication System
1. **User Management**
   - Implement User entity and repository
   - Create UserService with CRUD operations
   - Implement UserController with basic endpoints
   - Test user creation and retrieval

2. **JWT Authentication**
   - Implement JWT token generation and validation
   - Create authentication endpoints (login/register)
   - Set up security configuration
   - Test authentication flow with Postman

### Phase 3: Simulation Data Loading
1. **JSON Data Parser**
   - Create Vehicle entity and repository
   - Implement JSON parsing service
   - Create data loading endpoint
   - Test data loading with ev_simulation_logs.json

2. **Vehicle State Generation**
   - Implement VehicleState entity
   - Create state generation service
   - Add state generation endpoint
   - Test state generation with sample timestamps

### Phase 4: Core Vehicle Management
1. **Vehicle Tracking**
   - Implement vehicle state retrieval endpoints
   - Add real-time position tracking
   - Create vehicle status endpoints
   - Test vehicle tracking with Postman

2. **Battery Management**
   - Implement battery level tracking
   - Add low battery notifications
   - Create battery status endpoints
   - Test battery management features

### Phase 5: Charging Station Management
1. **Station Operations**
   - Implement ChargingStation entity
   - Create station management endpoints
   - Add station status tracking
   - Test station operations

2. **Charging Sessions**
   - Implement ChargingSession entity
   - Create session management endpoints
   - Add session status tracking
   - Test charging session management

### Phase 6: Route Optimization
1. **Route Calculation**
   - Implement route optimization service
   - Create route recommendation endpoints
   - Add distance and energy calculations
   - Test route optimization

2. **Charging Recommendations**
   - Implement charging station recommendation service
   - Create recommendation endpoints
   - Add availability checking
   - Test charging recommendations

### Phase 7: Notification System
1. **Notification Management**
   - Implement Notification entity
   - Create notification service
   - Add notification endpoints
   - Test notification system

### Phase 8: Admin Features
1. **System Monitoring**
   - Implement system health tracking
   - Create admin dashboard endpoints
   - Add user management features
   - Test admin functionality

## Testing Strategy
Each phase will include:
1. Unit tests for services
2. Integration tests for controllers
3. Postman testing for API endpoints
4. Documentation of test cases and results

## Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch for each phase
2. Implement functionality
3. Write tests
4. Test with Postman
5. Document API endpoints
6. Review and merge
7. Move to next phase

## Postman Testing Checklist
For each phase, we'll create a Postman collection with:
- Request examples
- Expected responses
- Test cases
- Documentation

## Documentation Requirements
- API documentation for each endpoint
- Database schema documentation
- Authentication flow documentation
- Testing documentation
- Deployment instructions

## Next Steps
1. Begin with Phase 1: Project Setup
2. Set up development environment
3. Create initial project structure
4. Configure database connection
5. Start implementing first functionality

Let's begin with Phase 1 and proceed step by step, ensuring each functionality works correctly before moving to the next phase.
